            <h2>The Role Model Of India</h2>
            <p><b>Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902)</b> is best known in
                 the United States for his groundbreaking speech to
                  the 1893 World’s Parliament of Religions in which 
                  he introduced Hinduism to America and called for 
                  religious tolerance and an end to fanaticism. Born 
                  Narendranath Dutta, he was the chief disciple of the 
                  19th-century mystic Ramakrishna and the founder of 
                  Ramakrishna Mission. Swami Vivekananda is also considered a key figure in the introduction of 
                  Vedanta and Yoga to the West and is credited with raising the profile of Hinduism to that of a 
                  world religion.
